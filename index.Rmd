## Introduction
Tourism is a popular economic activity that has developed significantly over the years. Itâ€™s an activity that can bring benefit to a country's government and its local residents. Such activity is recognized in almost every nations in the world. Accordingly, for this group project our team is going analyse the correlation between a country's GDP and the number of outbound tourists each country has using the [Number of Tourists vs GDP Data-Set](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-tourists-outbound-vs-level-of-prosperity-of-the-home-country).The data was collected through several avenues. The country prosperity was calculated based on the Global World Bank's World Development Indicators -- gross domestic product purchasing power parity (GDP PPP). This is a country's GDP converted to international dollars. The number of outbound tourists was calculated based on data from the Global World Bank which measured the number of times a citizen made a departure from their country for non-commercial purposes. This data set covers 1800s up to 2017.
