# Final Project Description

## Domain of Interest: Tourism
1.  Why are you interested in this field/domain?

  * Our team is interested in the field of **tourism** because we all enjoy traveling around the world. We like exploring new places, experiencing new cultures, taking pictures, and *especially* trying new, authentic food!


2.  What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?

  * Project A:  ["International tourism: Number of arrivals"](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/international-tourism-number-of-arrivals?tab=chart)

      - This project shows data of the number of people who travel and arrive to each country other than their usual residence whose main purpose in visiting is not commercial from 1995 to 2016. It also uses color gradient to show the amount of people on an interactive map and a line chart to represent change in numbers over the years per country. 

  * Project B:  ["Number of tourist departures per 1,000 people"](https://ourworldindata.org/tourism#all-charts-preview)

  * Project C:  ["International tourism: number of tourists vs. GDP of home country"](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-tourists-outbound-vs-level-of-prosperity-of-the-home-country?tab=chart)

      - This project shows data on the relationship between a country's GDP and the number of outbound tourists is has, from the years 1995 to 2016. It also uses color coding to represent what continent each country is part of.

  * Project D:  ["International tourism expenditures in current prices"](https://knoema.com/atlas/maps/Tourism-expenditures)

      - This project reflects the tourism expenditures of each country by the year and amount of money that was spent, it also used color gradient to show the amount of expenditures on the map.


3. What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?

  * Question 1: "Which country do people most travel to each year?"

    - This question can be answered using data by comparing numbers of arrivals per country and identifying which country has the most arrivals of tourists.

  * Question 2: "Of the people traveling out of a country, how many are traveling for reasons other than business?"

  * Question 3: "Does the wealth of a country affect how many of its citizens travel?"
    - The question can be answered by comparing the country's GDP to the amount of citizens who leave the country as tourists.

  * Question 4: "How does a country's tourism expenditures show the well-being of its economy?"
    - The question can be answered by comparing the country's GDP to its tourism expenditures.

## Finding Data
1. Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?

  * Project A:  [International arrivals by country](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/international-tourism-number-of-arrivals)

  * Project B:  [Number of tourist departures per 1,000 people](https://ourworldindata.org/tourism#all-charts-preview)

  * Project C:  [Number of tourists vs level of prosperity of home country](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-tourists-outbound-vs-level-of-prosperity-of-the-home-country)

  * Project D:  [International tourism, expenditures (current US$)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ST.INT.XPND.CD)

2. How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?

  * Project A:  The data was collected through different methods across countries. Some were collected from administrative records, border statistics, like police and immigration, some were supplemented by border surveys, and some were from tourism accommodation establishments. The data was sourced from World Tourism Organization (WTO), a United Nations agency, Yearbook of Tourism Statistics, and Compendium of Tourism Statistics.

    The data is about international tourism, specifically regarding the number of arrivals per country in the time span of 1995 to 2016.

  * Project B: The data was generated taking population information and tourist departure information from the World Bank's World Development Indicators. Tourism information was gathered from data on flight arrivals and overnight stays along with payment information. Our World in Data took population information and tourist departure information to create the datset: Number of tourist departures per 1,000 people.

  * Project C:  The data for this project was collected through several avenues. The country prosperity was calculated based on the Global World Bank's World Development Indicators -- gross domestic product purchasing power parity (GDP PPP). This is a country's GDP converted to international dollars. The number of outbound tourists was calculated based on data from the Global World Bank which measured the number of times a citizen made a departure from their country for non-commercial purposes. This data set covers 1800s up to 2017.

  * Project D:  The data was sourced from World Tourism Organization, Yearbook of Tourism Statistics, Compendium of Tourism Statistics and data files. and collected by The World Bank. The data is about international tourism expenditures from 1995 to 2018.
