2. How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?

  Project A:  The data was collected through different methods across countries. Some were collected from administrative records, border statistics, like police and immigration, some were supplemented by border surveys, and some were from tourism accommodation establishments. The data was sourced from World Tourism Organization (WTO), a United Nations agency, Yearbook of Tourism Statistics, and Compendium of Tourism Statistics.

  The data is about international tourism, specifically regarding the number of arrivals per country in the time span of 1995 to 2016.

  Project B:  

  Project C:  The data for this project was collected through several avenues. The country prosperity was calculated based on the Global World Bank's World Development Indicators -- gross domestic product purchasing power parity (GDP PPP). This is a country's GDP converted to international dollars. The number of outbound tourists was calculated based on data from the Global World Bank which measured the number of times a citizen made a departure from their country for non-commercial purposes. This data set covers 1800s up to 2017.

  Project D:  The data was sourced from World Tourism Organization, Yearbook of Tourism Statistics, Compendium of Tourism Statistics and data files. and collected by The World Bank. The data is about international tourism expenditures from 1995 to 2018.
